## Installation

Install with npm:

    npm install --save angular-eha.cordova.google-analytics

Or alternatively, with Bower:

    bower install --save angular-eha.cordova.google-analytics

## Usage

1. Ensure google-analytics-plugin is [installed][] correctly.
   `window.analytics` should be set if all's well.

2. Add `eha.cordova.google-analytics` to your app's module dependencies:

    ```js
    angular.module('app', [
      'eha.cordova.google-analytics'
    ]);
    ```

3. Pass a Google Analytics tracking ID in a `config` block:

    ```js
    angular.module('app')
      .config(function(ehaGoogleAnalyticsProvider) {
        ehaGoogleAnalyticsProvider.trackingID = 'UA-000000-01';
      });
    ```

## Services

### `ehaGoogleAnalytics`

Exposes the `trackEvent` and `setUserId` methods from google-analytics-plugin's
[JS API][]:

* `ehaGoogleAnalytics.trackEvent('Category', 'Action', ['Label', ['Value']])`
* `ehaGoogleAnalytics.setUserId('my-user-id')`

â€¦ and adds the following event listeners:

#### `$stateChangeSuccess`

(Assumes [ui-router][] is in use).

Tracks the current screen (page view) using `state.name`.

#### `$stateNotFound`

(Assumes [ui-router][] is in use).

Tracks a `stateNotFound` event, with the action `unfoundState.to` and label
`fromState`.

## Directives

### `ehaGaClick`

Add the `ehaGaClick` attribute to an element to track click events.

```html
<a eha-ga-click="label">Action</a>
```

Events are reported under `Click` category, with the element's text used as the
action. Optionally, pass a value to the directive to report as the event's
label.

## Decorators

### `ehaGaDecorator`

This decorates Angular's [$exceptionHandler][] service, reporting `Exception`
events, with the exception's message as the action and the stack trace as the event's label.

**Note**, we use a standard Google Analytics event (with the `Exception`
category) rather than the [exceptions][] method as the latter is limited to a
100 character string.
